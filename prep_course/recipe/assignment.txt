Assignment: Your Favourite Recipe

Using Sublime, create an HTML recipe page for your favourite dish.
At minimum, you must use at least all of the following HTML tags on your recipe web page: section, p, h1, h2, h3, ul, li,strong, em, img
Your recipe should have at least 3 sections:
 • Photo: No body wants to follow a recipe without some photos. You should have at least three. Maybe one per recipe instruction? Up to you.
 • Ingredients list: try and be creative with the formatting in this section
 • Directions
Keep it simple at first, focusing more on HTML structure and less on CSS styling.
Once you have a nice semantic HTML page, go ahead and style with CSS. Do your best to organize your CSS and markup based on SMACSS.
You can style however you like, but make sure you include at least one instance of each of these effects:
1. Image styling
 • Use CSS3 styles to add rounded or circular border around the images.
 • Add a drop shadow.
 • Maybe crop the photos using only CSS3.
 • Be creative and play around with the settings in Chrome before applying them to your CSS (for speed).
2. Styling change on hover
 • Apply a hover effect to some aspect of the recipe site so that when someone hovers, it rotates/tilts, grows, changes border colour, etc or a combination of that.
 • Use of CSS3 transforms is encouraged.
 • Transition the effect so that the transformation is not sudden.
Tips:
 • Use Sublime Text to create a recipe.html and style.css file somewhere on your computer
 • Open the file in Google Chrome instead of another browser
 • Use Chrome DevTools to quickly experiment with changes / fixes to your source code
 • When making changes to the source code, Save the source code in sublime before switching back to Chrome

Remember where you saved and don't delete recipe.html, you will be using it later.

Include the jQuery library in our html document. In the <head> of your recipe html let's include the jQuery library from an external source by adding the following line:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
Now, create and save a file called script.js in the same directory as our recipe html document.
Include it in the <head> of your html document. Somewhere around your stylesheet link tag, include this:
<script src="script.js"></script>
Perfect. Add your "document ready" function in your script.js just like you've been working on in the Codecademy jQuery exercises:
$(document).ready(function() {
});
Let's make sure everything's working by adding logging something to the console. Make script.js look like this:
$(document).ready(function() {
  console.log("Script included!");
});
Open your html document and check your console. You should see "Script included!" and no errors. If you do, work from the beginning of these steps and check for errors in the console along the way.

Instructions
Now that we have our script.js included, let's make our recipe interactive. Be creative as you work through these user stories. There are lots of options for how to accomplish these!
	1. Users can mark an ingredient after they buy it.
	2. Users can keep their place in the directions list as they cook.
	3. Users can hide all photos.
You'll need to use the jQuery docs as you try to figure out how to accomplish each effect you're looking for.
