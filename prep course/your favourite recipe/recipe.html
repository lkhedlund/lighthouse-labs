                <p>O.k., so maybe that header isn't butter chicken pizza, but it got you hungry, right? And there's nothing quite like butter chicken after a day of fresh powder or, as is often the case, the fresh hell of pure ice (hello rockies!).

But what's the best way to get the butter chicken into, as Swede's often say, your mouth hole? <strong>Butter chicken pizza!</strong></p>
                <p>By the time you're done that last slice, you're not going to want to eat butter chicken any other way.</p>
