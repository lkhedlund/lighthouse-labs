<h2>Part 1 (5 points)</h2>
<p>Make the blue box such that when it is clicked, make it turn into a green 30x30 circle over a course of 2 seconds. </p>
<p> While this can be done with jQuery's animation capabilities, for simple transitions such as this, we should use <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/css3-transitions/">CSS3 transitions</a>. To that end, <strong>make sure to use CSS3 transitions</strong> to achieve this. Yes you will still need to write some JS/jQuery since clicking the blue-box DIV needs to trigger the CSS3 transition.</p>
<p>Edit the page source to begin.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Part 2 (5 points)</h2>
<p>
	3 seconds after the animation is done running (so 5 seconds after the box is clicked), make the blue area go back to its original state. Once again, the box/circle should be slowly animating over a course of 2 seconds.
