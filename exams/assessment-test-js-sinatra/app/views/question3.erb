<p>Write a function called <code>findLongestWord</code> that takes in an array of words, and returns the longest one. If there are more than one words that are the largest, returning any of them is fine.</p>
<p>Once you have written the correct solution in the dedicated area, the failing tests below will succeed.</p>

<p>Edit the the page source to begin.</p>

<script>

  function findLongestWord(words) {
    /**** YOU MAY MODIFY THE CODE BELOW ****/
    var longest_word = [""]
    for (var i = 0; i <= words.length-1; i++) {
      if (words[i].length > longest_word[0].length) {
        longest_word[0] = words[i];
      }
    }
    // console.log(longest_word);
    return longest_word;
    /**** STOP MODIFYING HERE. ****/
  }
