# lighthouse-labs
All of the coursework-related projects I completed while at Lighthouse Labs. Larger projects have their own repositories.

##Disclaimer
I used my time at Lighthouse Labs to try new things and push my understanding of the concepts in new directions. If I didn't understand something, I messed around with it in code to break it/make it work. This means that some of the code is really, really awful. It's formatted well, all pretty-like, but the OOP principles need a lot of work.

Please look at the individual respositories for a better sense of my abilities.
