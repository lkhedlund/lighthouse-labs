At one time, I was on 8 or 9 presciption drugs and I spent 3.5 years in constant, excruciating, please-kill-me-now pain. I reached a point where the <i>only</i> thing I wanted was to hurt less and doctors were not offering me that. My pulmonologist told me &quot;People like you don&#x27;t get well. Symptom management is the name of the game.&quot;<p>So I began pursuing alternative treatments because doctors had no hope to give me. I did whatever reduced my pain, during a time when I was routinely hallucinating conversations with The Grim Reaper. And when I hallucinated that he peered down into my face, saw something he had not seen before and turned his black steed to leave, I ran screaming after him &quot;Take me with you!&quot; I knew the death watch was over and I would live. I also knew I faced a long, hard, torturous recovery. It was a journey I had no desire to make.<p>I think there are things worse than death. And I also very much fear two things: 1) That every minute put into researching heroics like artificial hearts is a minute taken away from researching something more humane and 2) the extremely high value we place on just making sure no one dies, and quality of life be damned, gives patients like me a very grim future, even if we get the best available care and do everything &quot;right&quot; (according to our doctors).<p>That answer is not intended as dramatics or as anything screechy. It is just honest commentary on my actual experiences that my views grow out of. Your question is a very reasonable one. I think my concerns are equally reasonable.

You kind of waved off my concerns and didn&#x27;t really ask a question. So I am concerned that replying is a mistake. But I seem to be damned no matter what I do when it comes to topics like this. I mean, why did you reply? The manner in which you replied seems pretty dismissive, given that I closed with a statement that I have a condition where transplants are common.<p>But assuming you answered in good faith and just honestly don&#x27;t see how bad your reply could sound to me, here is what disturbs me:<p>If you have certain conditions, doctors don&#x27;t really try to help you maintain better health. They chalk up bad outcomes to your official diagnosis and kind of wash their hands of trying harder. Then heroic interventions, like transplants, get all kinds of glowing press.<p>When you get listed for transplant, you basically sit around waiting for someone relatively young and healthy to die tragically in an accident so you can have a second shot at life. I can&#x27;t imagine the toll that takes on your psyche.<p>That isn&#x27;t a criticism of patients who accept the only option they are really being offered. But I think we can do better than that, and real quality of life is being given short shrift as medical professionals zealously pursue the &quot;Ooh, shiny!&quot; options that will get them impressive headlines. I also understand the pressures on them which lead to that, but it is the patients who suffer horribly because of it.<p>It just makes me think something is very, very broken.
